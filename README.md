I had a baby girl last week, first baby. Therefor it was not easy to find time to sit and work
on the project without being bothered. We're not gonna get an extension (that's what Yair advised) but we are 
asking for a consideration on the final grade, because we really deserve it. Thanks.

Bonus's we did:
1) All kinds of Binding
2) Control Template
3) Progress Bar
4) Customer Interface
5) Call to BL in BackgroundWorker
6) Observer Collection
7) IConverter
8) No sharing info between Windows, sending bl as argument and all kinds of funcs and Delegates
9) Display Location in sexagesimali
10) Working with XML files and config.XML
11) Delete options
12) Maps
13) DataContext
